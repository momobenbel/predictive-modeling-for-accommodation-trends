# Predictive Modeling for One-Night Accommodation Trends

In this analysis, we utilized data science methodologies to investigate factors influencing one-night accommodation decisions. Through advanced clustering and regression techniques, we analyzed variables such as price, location, and guest reviews to predict booking patterns. The project involved exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and the application of predictive models, yielding actionable insights into the accommodation industryâ€™s dynamics.
